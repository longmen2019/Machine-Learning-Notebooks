# Bike Sharing Demand Analysis - Regression

This project analyzes bike-sharing demand data using machine learning regression models. It is part of the broader [Machine-Learning-Notebooks](https://github.com/longmen2019/Machine-Learning-Notebooks) repository, aimed at showcasing practical applications of data science and machine learning techniques.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to predict bike rental demand based on various factors like weather conditions, date/time, and user type. By employing regression models, we aim to gain insights into how these factors influence the demand for bike-sharing services.

## Features

- **Data Cleaning:** Handling missing values, outlier detection, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:** Visualizing data trends and distributions.
- **Regression Modeling:** Implementation of machine learning models to predict demand.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Assessment of model performance using metrics like RMSE and RÂ².

## Requirements

This project was developed using Python and Jupyter Notebook. To run the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
