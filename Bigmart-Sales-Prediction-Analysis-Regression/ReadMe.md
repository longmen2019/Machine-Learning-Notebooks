## Introduction
The goal of this project is to build predictive models to estimate the sales of products in different Bigmart outlets. By leveraging regression algorithms, we aim to uncover relationships between the features and the target variable (sales) and improve the overall forecasting accuracy.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this analysis includes information about various products and stores, such as:
- Item Identifier
- Item Weight
- Item Fat Content
- Item Visibility
- Item Type
- Item MRP
- Outlet Identifier
- Outlet Establishment Year
- Outlet Size
- Outlet Location Type
- Outlet Type

## Installation
To get started, clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/longmen2019/Machine-Learning-Notebooks.git
cd Machine-Learning-Notebooks/Bigmart-Sales-Prediction-Analysis-Regression
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load and preprocess the data using the `data_preprocessing.py` script or the `01_data_preprocessing.ipynb` notebook.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Explore the dataset using the `02_eda.ipynb` notebook to understand the data distribution and relationships.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features and transform the existing ones using the `03_feature_engineering.ipynb` notebook or the `feature_engineering.py` script.
4. **Modeling**: Train different regression models using the `04_modeling.ipynb` notebook or the `modeling.py` script.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the models using the `05_evaluation.ipynb` notebook or the `evaluation.py` script.

## Results
The results of the analysis and model predictions will be documented in the notebooks. The final models' performance metrics will be shared in the evaluation notebook.
