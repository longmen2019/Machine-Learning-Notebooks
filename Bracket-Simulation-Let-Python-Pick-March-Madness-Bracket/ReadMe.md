# 🏀 Bracket Simulation: Let Python Pick Your March Madness Bracket  

This Python project simulates basketball tournament outcomes based on team rankings (seeds) and probabilities. Leveraging the power of Python and data science, it models matchups, predicts winners, and determines the ultimate tournament champion!  

## 🔧 Features  
- **Seed-Based Weighting**: Simulations factor in team seeds to calculate probabilities.
- **Dynamic Matchups**: Handles multiple rounds of tournament matchups seamlessly.
- **Randomized Results**: Incorporates randomness for realistic and varied outcomes.
- **Modular Design**: Easy to extend or adapt for other types of tournaments.  

## 🚀 Technologies Used  
- **Python**: The programming language used for the simulation.
- **Random Module**: To enable randomness in outcomes.
- **Dataclasses**: Simplifies data structure creation for managing team data.  

## 🏗️ How It Works  
1. Each team is assigned a seed, where lower seeds represent higher-ranked teams.  
2. Probabilities are calculated for each matchup based on the team's seeds.  
3. The simulation progresses round by round until a champion is determined.  

## 📂 File Overview  
- **madness.py**: Contains the code for the simulation, including team definitions and tournament logic.  

## 💻 Usage  
1. Clone the repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/longmen2019/Machine-Learning-Notebooks.git
   ```  
2. Navigate to the project directory:  
   ```bash
   cd Machine-Learning-Notebooks/Bracket-Simulation-Let-Python-Pick-March-Madness-Bracket
   ```  
3. Run the simulation:  
   ```bash
   python madness.py
   ```
