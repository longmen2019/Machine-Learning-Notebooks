    "## Stratified KFold\n",
    "\n",
    "### Introduction\n",
    "KFold validation does not preserve the split of the output variable while splitting the data into k-folds. This can lead to issues, especially in cases where the distribution of the output variable is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example Scenario\n",
    "Imagine training a Naive Bayes classifier using KFold validation with 10 samples, where 5 are positive and 5 are negative. Since KFold randomly selects the split, it could result in an unfortunate situation where one split contains all positive samples and another contains all negative samples. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Problem with KFold\n",
    "In such a scenario, the Naive Bayes classifier will calculate the prior probabilities and find them to be 100%, meaning the model will incorrectly conclude that the output is always positive. This is clearly an inaccurate representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Solution: Stratified KFold\n",
    "To address this issue, we use **Stratified KFold**. This method ensures that the split in the original dataset is preserved in the training set. Essentially, if the original dataset has 50% positive and 50% negative outputs, then the training set will also have 50% positive and 50% negative outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Benefits of Stratified KFold\n",
    "- **Preserves Distribution**: Maintains the balance of the output variable across the folds.\n",
    "- **Reduces Bias**: Prevents the model from learning skewed distributions that could occur with random splits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Stratified KFold is particularly useful in scenarios where the output variable has a skewed distribution, ensuring that each fold is representative of the overall dataset.\n"
